# Corbin.Dev Frontend
This is all the frontend code for my personal site, [corbin.dev](https://corbin.dev/), presented "as is" for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

## Current State
Parts of this site are unfinished, as it mostly re-written and migrated from an older version of Angualr. As such, it is missing the unit tests still, and the CV builder only half fixed. It needs more refactors, cleanup, and obviously full test coverage, which will happen someday when I have more then 2 minutes of free time per week.
