# Corbin.Dev Frontend
This is all the frontend code for my personal site, [corbin.dev](https://corbin.dev/), presented "as is" for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

## Current State of the Site
Right now this site is in _rough_ shape, as I am rebuilding it from an older module based project to the newer SSR and Standalone based structure preferred by NG17. This code does __NOT__ accurately represent the currently deployed build of the site. In fact, it does not even compile as of writing, since it contains a bunch of components from the previous version, complete with their now broken and nonsensical imports.

I am currently going component-by-component and converting them to the new NG17 syntax, as well as taking the time to refactor a bit and cleanup some of the code that was previously rushed.

My CV builder tool, in particular, needs a lot of refactoring, as the bones of that entire module were built in about 5 hours to meet an internship submission deadline. Needlessly to say, the priority at the time was to have a nice looking output PDF, and not super elegant and hyper optimized components.

tl;dr, it's an in-progress migration and does not currently build as of 22.01.24.
