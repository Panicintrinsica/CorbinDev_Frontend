# Corbin.Dev Frontend
This is all the frontend code for my personal site, [corbin.dev](https://corbin.dev/), presented "as is" for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

## Current State
Parts of this site are unfinished, as it was quickly migrated from an older version of Angular. As such, it is missing the unit tests still, and the CV builder only half fixed. It needs more refactors, cleanup, and obviously full test coverage, which will happen someday when I have more than 2 minutes of free time per week. (Turns out that full-time university, plus a job, plus job hunting, takes up a lot of time)
