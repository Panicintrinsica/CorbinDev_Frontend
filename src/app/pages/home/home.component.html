    Rare is the application that does not need to rely on external data. When you require a new RESTful system, have complex business logic that needs to be processed, or need to interface with third-party APIs, I have the skills to get the job done securely and efficiently.

    I can write more than simple CRUD applications, and if your project needs lower-level work, I can do anything from modular video game logic to highly specialized tools. And if I <i>don't</i> know how to do it, then I can find out how. I'll even learn x86 Assembly if I have too.
    <br><br>In fairness, I'd learn Assembly just for the fun of it at this point.
